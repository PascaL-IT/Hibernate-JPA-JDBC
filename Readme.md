# Accessing databases in Java with JDBC and Hibernate ORM

Training course to learn and to practice with JDBC, Hibernate ORM and the JPA API.

Most of applications have to keep and manage data on the long term. The Java platform provides an API called JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to do this by accessing database management systems like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL ...

ORM frameworks (Object Relational Mapping), like Hibernate, enable developers to more easily write applications whose data outlives the application process. 

In addition to its own "native" API, Hibernate is also an implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA) specification. As JPA Provider, it can be easily used in any environment supporting JPA including Java SE applications, Java EE, Jakarta EE application servers.

In this course, JDBC, Hibernate and JPA technologies are introduced, along with architecture concepts to best fit on Java desktop application or a Web application. 

Important notions seen in this course are : architecture layers (Consumer/Controller, Service, Persistence/DAO), business domain (Entities), repositories, Data Transfer Object (DTO), transactional management and lazy loading.
